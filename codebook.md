# Code book for the tidy dataset
The tidy dataset has two id variables: Labels and Subject. These are in the first two columns. Since there are 6 activity labels and 30 test subjects, the tidy dataset has 180 rows. 

Each row has 86 features  or variables which are columns. The columns names are the original feature names. I felt that they were sufficiently descriptives to warrant any changes, so I've left them alone. For a full list of features, see features.txt in the original dataset.

In the tidy data set each column is an average of all original observations for a given activity, subject, and feature.
